Movie Suggest

- User enters, for eg sake, 3 movies. He wants to see a movie similar to these. The app suggests a movie.
- Fetches trailer from youtube
- Fetches ratings and reviews from IMDB, rotten tomatoes etc. 
- In background, app builds a database of all movies that were entered by the user so that it can suggest movies without the 3 movie input too.
